## The Content

This is the fourth element of **the Big Bang of Data Science**, **`Prediction from the Start to The End`**.  
I don’t want to stick to that _abstract and direct_ definition from the academic book, on the meaning of coding, but from the industrial one. So, I believe **CODING** is a language syntax that machines use to communicate to or with. In other words, just like humans, machines use their own language, recently in the form of a digital form of [0, 1], to speak to each other or with us. So, if you **code** something it’s as if you are authoring a text, where the code is the structure and syntax of that language you author of, and the rules and structure of that language must be then obeyed. As if a text is authored using a human language, the form of outcome must be a book, or a paper, or similar forms; if you **code** using any programming language, then the outcome form is going to be a **GUI** form which can be of taking input as arguments and outcome results to screen, or just a script that execute certain tasks.  


So, since we have established that level of understanding on the meaning of coding, then let us connect the dots with the aim of [The Big Bang of Datat Science](https://github.com/dahmansphi/big_bang_of_data_science_project). In the main introduction of [the big bang of data science](https://youtu.be/xyNu7t9KTgc), I have mentioned that the outcome from the first **two books*: [Research from the start to the end](https://github.com/dahmansphi/research_from_start_to_end) and [analysis from the start to the end](https://github.com/dahmansphi/analysis_from_start_to_end) you have an __analytical model__ which is used as an input to the third book __prediction from the start to the end__ the outcome was a __predictive model__. 
Then I set the argument that we shall use this model in somehow; that was two possible ways: (**a**) as a backend to GUI interface, e.g. _desktop app, mobile app, or desktop app_. Alternatively, (**b**) we can use the model to _embed it into a machine_ that machine then act as smart one so to speak. 

In the first edition of [the Big Bang of Data Science](https://youtu.be/0weCBnNO7tk) I have established the fact to transform this __predictive model__ as a backend to a __GUI__ interface. That is exactly the main aim of this material. Where we shall discuss how to fix this __predictive model__ as a backend for an __interface__. We are going to use a specific form in this edition that __GUI__ or interface shall be __desktop application__. However, this idea can span to other forms such as __mobile app__, or __web app__, but the concept is the same. 

We are going to use a common programming language in this material, that is __Python__, however alternative options are possible as well. In addition, we shall utilize most of the __CURD__ operations that standard operation apps would do, moreover, the utilization of __Database__ structure, even though, the choice would be primitive, however it can span to more complicated scenarios. As you will most likely understand that Python is the language we write, so to transform that script into a GUI we can utilize available packages such as PyQt to accomplish that aim. 

To this end, **the fourth book** is carefully crafted to meet all the requirements to make that kind of transformation option from __predictive model__ into a __GUI__. Here is a quick view of the content of the book.

# Book competitive advantage

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> 1. The main principle of this material is to fix you in the state of independence, where you can build, assemble and create your complete own AI model. For that reason, the main element to accomplish that is comprehensive level of understanding Math, so the first step it shows you how math is an independent language, and then introduces you the main field of math for you to conceptualize its importance.. 
> 2. Based on the first advantage, the material selects several subjects of math that you must know and master. Those subjects are discussed not from a rigid abstract of math but from a wider level of understanding the use of it as an independent language. Moreover, every line of this subject is applied with real life example and code implementation in Python, in addition to visualization ability.
> 3. The map of prediction is a very unique way this material illustrates the entire world of AI. It shows you the input process and output of this phenomenon. More important, in every possible type of predictive model, e.g. regression, classification or clustering, it implements them using several common types of algorithms and methods from scratch to the end. In this way you will have strong ability from abstract and applied way.
> 4. Unlike many materials that speak about the subject of AI and machine learning, it presents some common frameworks as the basis, this material shows you that you can utilize any of those frameworks, or even re-engineer them your way. For instance, it shows you frameworks of Neural network, CNN, RNN, Reinforcement learning, which are discussed as an independent training programs, but once you master the math of AI you will see that you only need few minutes to build from scratch on your own. Moreover, you will write your own code to do so using Python.
> 5. Finally, if you have come from background with no experience in code writing, this material introduces a whole appendix coaching you on learning Python from the start to the end. so, in this case, you can even procced from the very beginning.
