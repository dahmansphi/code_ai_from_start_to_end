# Documentation

## Environment

It is recommended to create virtual environment before you start on the implementation step

```python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment```

Activate the virtual env on Windows

```tutorial-env\Scripts\activate```

Activate the virtual env on Unix or MacOS, run:

```source tutorial-env/bin/activate```
